# JavaLevel2Prompts-pythonVersion
a series of user prompts written in java originally, transfered to python.  
Along my path of learning Java syntax, this was a checkpoint in my course.  So i decided to do what any normal person would do and transfer it to python.  
Feel free to use any of the segments of this app as a base for apps you may want to build, but if using my code word for word and not making any of your
own concepts, please give me credit!  Thanks!
